    <strong id="abv">PRESIDENTIAL INITAITIVE FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING</strong>
    <p>
        Presidential Initaitive for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded
        not-for-profit
        educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help
        promote education, research and business opportunities is emerging tech fields like

    <p>
        The <strong>Cloud Native Computing</strong> program prepares the students to program in open source
        technologies
        like, <em><strong>Linux,
                Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native</strong></em> while introducing the
        students
        to
        development of
        Microservices and software development techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.
    </p>
    <h2 id="ai">Artificial Intelligence:</h2>
    <p>The <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the
        AI
        technology, via
        teaching programming in open source languages like <em><strong>Python, Numpy, Pandas, Tensorflow 2.0 and
                Flask,</strong></em> and teaching
        deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in
        practice.
    </p>
    <h2 id="bc">Blockchain:</h2>
    <p>The main emphasis of <strong>Blockchain</strong> program is to understand the blockchains like
        <em><strong>Ethereum and
                Hyperledger (Fabric),</strong></em>
        and learn to program in languages such as Solidity, JavaScript on frameworks like Node.js. The program also
        introduces them to development of Distributed Apps (DApps), frameworks like Web3 and Truffle and an in-depth
        understanding of Blockchain-as-a-service (BaaS) and how to develop and offer an Initial Coin Offering (ICO)
        of a
        crypto-token.
    </p>
    <h2 id="iot">Internet of Things:</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Internet of things</strong> program introduces the students to open source development technologies
        like <em><strong>Rust,
                Embedded Rust, WebAssembly, Hyper, Diesel, Google Assistant, and Kubernetes</strong></em> while making
        them efficient in
        developing Micro Services for IoT Edge, IoT Cloud, and voice computing for device control.
